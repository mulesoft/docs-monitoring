The Anypoint Custom Metrics connector enables you to send operational and business metric values that you define from an app to Anypoint Monitoring. You can then use the built-in *Custom metrics* dashboard and a custom dashboard in *Advanced* mode to visualize the custom metrics in real time. 

Define metrics in the Anypoint Custom Metrics connector to select which metrics to display in the dashboard. You can filter and group the metrics along the dimensions you define to include multiple custom and built-in metrics in a single dashboard visualization.

The Custom Metrics connector is available for both Mule 3 and Mule 4 in the *Monitoring > Custom Metrics* page.

[NOTE] 
To see the metrics you configure in the Anypoint Custom Metrics connector in Anypoint Monitoring, you must have a Titanium subscription. 

== Prerequisites

include::partial$include-supported-mule-runtime-version.adoc[]

You must also xref:am-installing.adoc[install the Anypoint Monitoring Agent].

== Use Design Center to Configure the Custom Metrics Values

Create a Mule application project in Design Center and configure the Custom Metrics connector.

. In *Design Center*, create a new Mule application project. +
The project opens in Design Center. 
. Select the trigger for your flow, and click *Next*.
. For *Target*, select *Anypoint Custom Metrics Connector*, and click *Done*. 
+
image::custom-metric-dc-select-target.png[]
+
The connector has one operation called *Send Custom Metric*. 
. On the design canvas, open the *Anypoint Custom Metrics Connector* card to add your metrics.
. In *Metric Name*, enter a meaningful value. 
. Next to *Dimensions*, click *Add* to enter the name and value for the metric's dimension.  
+
image::custom-metric-dc-add-dimension.png[]
.. In the *Add Item* dialog box, enter the *Dimension Name* and *Value* for the dimension.
.. Leave the *Collapsible* option with the default of *True*.
.. Click *OK*. 
+
image::custom-metric-dc-add-item.png[]
+
You can repeat these steps to add multiple key values.
.  Next to *Facts*, click *Add* to add facts for the metric. Values for measurements are always numerical.
.. In the *Add Item* dialog box, enter a *Fact Name* and numerical *Value* for the fact. +
[NOTE]
For facts, the value must always be numerical. This is not validated at design time, but a non-numerical value will cause a runtime exception once deployed.
+
image::custom-metrics-add-fact.png[]
+
.. Click *OK*. +
You can repeat these steps to add multiple key values.
. Select the *Throw Runtime Exception on Validation Failure* option if you want the flow to break if invalid values are entered for the metric. If this option is left unchecked, an error will be logged, but the flow won't break.
[NOTE]
Custom Metrics Connector requires all *Facts* to be sent from every operation, even if they contain empty or 0 value in them.

== Configure Custom Metrics Values Using Anypoint Studio

. Search Anypoint Exchange for the Anypoint Custom Metrics connector. 
. Drag the *Send Custom Metric* operation to the canvas. 
. Add the *Send Custom Metric* operation to your application flow. +
This image shows an example flow for custom metrics in Anypoint Studio. 
+
image::custom-metric-example-flow.png[]
. Click the *Send Custom Metric* operation to add values for the operation. 
. Add the dimension for the metric:
.. In *Metric name*, enter a meaningful value, for example "sales." 
.. In *Enter contextual information* select *Edit inline* to enter the name and value for the dimension. 
.. Click the green plus on the left to enter the values.
.. In the *Dimension* dialog box, enter the *Name* and *Value* for the dimension.
.. Leave the *Collapsible* option with the default of *True*.
.. Click *Finish*. +
You can repeat these steps to add multiple key values.
. Enter the facts for the metric. Values for measurements are numerical.
.. In *Enter measurements* select *Edit inline* to enter the name and value for the metric.
.. In the *Fact* dialog box, enter a *Name* and numerical *Value* for the fact. +
[NOTE]
For facts, the value must always be numerical. This is not validated at design time, but a non-numerical value will cause a runtime exception once deployed.
.. Leave the *Collapsible* option with the default of *True*.
.. Click *Finish*. +
You can repeat these steps to add multiple key values. +

+

+
. Select the *Throw runtime exception on validation failure* option if you want the flow to break if invalid values are entered for the metric. If this option is left unchecked, an error is will be logged, but the flow won't break.

== Deploy the Application

. Deploy the app.
. In Anypoint Monitoring, xref:dashboard-custom-config.adoc[add a new custom dashboard] for the custom metric. +
This image shows an example of the configuration for a graph to display t-shirt sales.
+
image::custom-metric-custom-dashboard-config.png[]
+
[NOTE]
You only see the custom metrics in the pre-populated metric selection drop-down lists once something is logged for the custom metric. 
+

== Use the Custom Metrics Dashboard

Custom metrics are not collected for the app until you configure the xref:connectors::metrics/custom-metrics-connector.adoc[Custom Metrics Connector] in your application flow and deploy the application to a server or server cluster. 

. In Anypoint Monitoring, select the application to view metrics for, and click *View*. 
. Click the *Custom metrics* tab. +
[NOTE]
If the Custom Metrics connector has collected one or more metrics in the specified time range, one chart per defined metric is displayed. 
+
image::custom-metrics-dashboard.png[]
+
. Click *Select a measurement for this chart* to display the measurement for the chart.
. Use the drop-down lists at the bottom of the chart to filter the data by: +
* *Aggregation* - Possible aggregations include:
** *None* (default) - No data aggregation.  
** *count* - Displays the total number of items collected for the measurement.
** *distinct* - Returns the unique values for the given measurement.
** *integral* - Returns the area under the curve for subsequent values.
** *mean* - Returns the arithmetic average of the specified measurement over a given interval of time.
** *median* - Displays the middle value for the collected metrics.
** *mode* - Displays the most frequent value in the metrics collected for the defined measurement. 
** *sum* - Displays the sum of all the values for the defined measurement. 
* *Measurement* - The choices in this list are determined by the measurement values you define in the Custom Metrics connector. 
* *Group by* - The choices in this list are determined by the values you define in the Custom Metrics connector.
