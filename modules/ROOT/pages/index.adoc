Understanding the state of your infrastructure and systems is important for ensuring the reliability and stability of your services. As part of Anypoint Platform, Anypoint Monitoring provides visibility into integrations across your app network. The monitoring tools provide feedback from Mule flows and components in your app network.

Operations and development teams use the monitoring tools to diagnose issues and prescribe solutions to behavior that negatively impacts digital performance. The monitoring tools are designed to reduce the time to identify and resolve these issues through aggregated metrics, data visualization tools, alerts for issues, and a log aggregation system. Specifically, Anypoint Monitoring provides ways to:

* Aggregate and map metrics across dependent systems in real-time.
* Configure dashboards and alerts to reduce the mean time to identification
of issues (MTTI).
* Store and search log data at scale.

== Key Features

Anypoint Monitoring provides the following features:

include::monitoring::partial$include-features.adoc[tags="feature-list"]

[[dashboards]]
=== Dashboards

Use built-in dashboards or customize your own to provide instant visibility into your applications' performance and detailed analysis of your network.

image::intro-dashboard-built-in.png[Built-in Dashboard Example]

Built-in and custom dashboards expose the metrics on your app network. They provide visual representations of your resources so you can detect anomalies, troubleshoot issues, and see trends that are not obvious in raw form.

A custom dashboard provides a single screen that can bring together specific metrics and data points that are important to your organization. Custom dashboards can display graphs and other charts, such as single statistics.

You can track many data points and metrics from a custom dashboard that looks across multiple services in the app and in your dashboards across all systems.

See xref:dashboards-using.adoc[Dashboards].

[[alerts]]
=== Event-Driven Alerts

Track trends and add your own alerts to identify abnormal behavior and problems in your application network.

image::intro-alerts.png[Alerts]

You can trigger alerts based on rules (or thresholds) and policies for your resources. When these thresholds are crossed for a certain period of time, you can receive notification to take action. The method of notification depends on the severity of the alert that you define.

See xref:alerts.adoc[Alerts].

[[logs]]
=== Logging System

Search across log files, including archived logs to find information and events based on a specific query.

image::intro-logs.png[Logs]

Anypoint Monitoring facilitates distributed log searches of raw log and event data from across the app network so that you can pinpoint the root cause of a problem.

The log aggregator system holds raw operational data and records events that occur in the operating system or Mule app. Log aggregation compiles, organizes, and indexes log files to facilitate management, searching, and analysis. Aggregated logs complement the monitoring system by helping you identify causes of operational issues and investigate failures.

See xref:logs.adoc[Logs].

[[data-retention]]
=== Data Storage and Retention

Limits on data storage and retention are determined by your pricing plan. All organizations receive Anypoint Monitoring regardless of pricing plan.

include::reuse::partial$billing/pricing.adoc[tag=dataRetentionMonitoring]

For complete details about pricing, contact your customer support representative. See also https://www.mulesoft.com/anypoint-pricing[Anypoint Platform pricing].

[[raw-data]]
=== Raw Data Downloads

You can download warehoused log data on a Mule app, for example, to help investigate  security, compliance, or other issues that logs can reveal.

See xref:raw-data.adoc[Raw Data].

[[tools]]
=== Tools for Monitoring Integrations

You can link to connectors that help deliver Anypoint Monitoring notifications to external systems, including custom metrics connectors.

See xref:tools.adoc[Tools].

[[functional-monitoring]]
=== API Functional Monitoring

Monitor APIs and endpoints at scheduled intervals. Receive reports about whether tests pass or fail, and view statistics about API and endpoint performance.

See xref:api-functional-monitoring::afm-in-anypoint-platform.adoc[API Functional Monitoring in Anypoint Monitoring].

== Monitoring Packages and Plans

The following packages and plans are available for Anypoint Monitoring:

* <<usage-based-packages>>
* <<subscription-plans>>

[[usage-based-packages]]
=== Anypoint Monitoring Features for Usage-Based Packages

Anypoint Monitoring is the standard method of monitoring Mule application and API performance so that you can quickly identify and resolve issues. All organizations receive monitoring capabilities regardless of pricing model. However, organizations that have the Anypoint Integration Advanced package receive more storage, guaranteed resources, and advanced capabilities that allow for greater control and flexibility.

//TODO_TODO_TODO: WORDING 
IMPORTANT: If your organization plans to change its subscription model from the Anypoint Advanced Integration package to the Anypoint Integration Starter package, first preserve your logs outside of Anypoint Platform. Within an hour of changing pricing models, MuleSoft clears the storage that retains log data.

include::reuse::partial$billing/pricing.adoc[tag=monitoringTable]

[[subscription-plans]]
=== Anypoint Monitoring Features for Legacy Subscription-Based Plans

Anypoint Monitoring is the standard method of monitoring Mule application and API performance so that you can more quickly identify and resolve issues. All organizations receive monitoring capabilities with their subscriptions. However, customers subscribing at the Titanium tier receive more storage, guaranteed resources, and advanced capabilities that allow for greater control and flexibility.

If your organization changes its subscription model from a Titanium to a Gold or Platinum subscription, ensure you have preserved your logs outside of Anypoint Platform. Within an hour of changing subscription models, MuleSoft clears the storage that formerly kept log data.

//TODO_TODO_TODO: VISUALIZER WIDGET STILL SUPPORTED? ANYPOINT VISUALIZER?
NOTE: Anypoint Visualizer application network integration refers to an Anypoint Visualizer widget within Anypoint Monitoring. Anypoint Visualizer as a product outside of Anypoint Monitoring is available to organizations regardless of pricing plan. 


== Use Cases

The following use cases provide examples of how you can use Anypoint Monitoring.

* Understand performance-related KPIs: +
DevOps engineer Gary maintains a series of APIs related to a transaction processing system. Because the TPS requires swift response time, Gary uses API response time <<dashboards, dashboards>> and <<alerts, alerts>> to send an email when there is a bottleneck. After gathering some data, Gary can then size his applications.

//TODO_TODO_TODO: VISUALIZER??? IS THAT STILL SUPPORTED.
* Plan resource allocation across the application network: +
IT specialist Peyton uses Anypoint Visualizer to view their application network. For CloudHub and Anypoint Runtime Fabric applications, Peyton sees CPU and memory utilization and idle capacity using integrated Anypoint Monitoring.

* Pinpoint root causes of issues: +
Support team member Darius receives a call that the system is running slowly. He examines <<dashboards, dashboards>> and checks response times, failed requests, and so on. He identifies that the backend is not scaling for the number of requests; he can add capacity for Mule apps, or he can throttle requests for other backend issues.

* Measure API trends: +
Architect Kara monitors several APIs using <<dashboards, dashboards>>, and she reports API call trends to leadership. She creates a custom dashboard that shows her top 10 API’s trends per month so she can easily identify APIs that have high volumes of calls or issues.

* Assess the stability of APIs: +
Operations administrator Vic can periodically assess the error rate and success rate of key APIs using aggregated views and computations in Anypoint Monitoring. Based on their observations, Vic can stabilize or redesign apps that perform poorly.

* Analyze logs: +
Support engineer Carole searches through Anypoint Monitoring <<logs, logs>> and notices some apps frequently have errors. She uses this data to create dashboards for areas that have frequent issues, and she creates a plan to improve end processes based on the types of errors identified in the logs.

* Visualize regional or project-based consumption: +
Business owner Devon has apps across different runtime planes. He has aggregated <<dashboards, dashboards>> of the regional or project-specific apps, and he can easily determine what is consuming the most resources and evangelize accordingly.
