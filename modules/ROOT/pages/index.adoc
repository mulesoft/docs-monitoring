Understanding the state of your infrastructure and systems is important for ensuring the reliability and stability of your services. As part of Anypoint Platform, Anypoint Monitoring provides visibility into integrations across your app network. The monitoring tools provide feedback from Mule flows and components in your app network.

Operations and development teams use the monitoring tools to diagnose issues and prescribe solutions to behavior that negatively impacts digital performance. The monitoring tools are designed to reduce the time to identify and resolve these issues through aggregated metrics, data visualization tools, alerts for issues, and a log aggregation system. Specifically, Anypoint Monitoring provides ways to:

* Aggregate and map metrics across dependent systems in real-time.
* Configure dashboards and alerts to reduce the mean time to identification
of issues (MTTI).
* Store and search log data at scale.

[[insights]]
=== Anypoint Insights Dashboards (CA and JA Regions)

In https://ca1.mulesoft.com/monitoring[CA] and https://ja1.mulesoft.com/monitoring[JA] regions, monitor performance data and issues across your CloudHub 2.0 and Runtime Fabric deployments (_entities_), and get more detailed insights on specific deployments with built-in dashboards. 

See xref:anypoint-insights.adoc[].

[[dashboards]]
=== Built-in and Custom Dashboards (US and EU Regions)

In https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/monitoring[US] and https://eu1.anypoint.mulesoft.com/monitoring[EU] regions, use built-in dashboards or customize your own to provide instant visibility into your apps' performance and detailed analysis of your network.

image::intro-dashboard-built-in.png[Built-in Dashboard Example]

Built-in and custom dashboards expose the metrics on your app network. They provide visual representations of your resources so you can detect anomalies, troubleshoot issues, and see trends that are not obvious in raw form.

A custom dashboard provides a single screen that can bring together specific metrics and data points that are important to your organization. Custom dashboards can display graphs and other charts, such as single statistics.

You can track many data points and metrics from a custom dashboard that looks across multiple services in the app and in your dashboards across all systems.

See xref:dashboards-using.adoc[Dashboards].

[[alerts]]
=== Event-Driven Alerts (US and EU Regions)

In https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/monitoring[US] and https://eu1.anypoint.mulesoft.com/monitoring[EU] regions, track trends and add your own alerts to identify abnormal behavior and problems in your app network.

image::intro-alerts.png[Alerts]

You can trigger alerts based on rules (or thresholds) and policies for your resources. When these thresholds are crossed for a certain period of time, you can receive notification to take action. The method of notification depends on the severity of the alert that you define.

See xref:alerts.adoc[Alerts].

//TODO_TODO_TODO: CHECK LOGGING IN HYPERFORCE REGIONS
[[logging]]
=== Logging System (US and EU Regions)

In https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/monitoring[US] and https://eu1.anypoint.mulesoft.com/monitoring[EU] regions, search across log files, including archived logs to find information and events based on a specific query.

image::intro-logs.png[Logs]

Anypoint Monitoring facilitates distributed log searches of raw log and event data from across the app network so that you can pinpoint the root cause of a problem.

The log aggregator system holds raw operational data and records events that occur in the operating system or Mule app. Log aggregation compiles, organizes, and indexes log files to facilitate management, searching, and analysis. Aggregated logs complement the monitoring system by helping you identify causes of operational issues and investigate failures.

See xref:logs.adoc[Logs].

[[data_storage_retention]]
=== Data Storage and Retention (US and EU Regions)

In https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/monitoring[US] and https://eu1.anypoint.mulesoft.com/monitoring[EU] regions, data storage and retention limits are determined by your pricing plan. All organizations receive Anypoint Monitoring regardless of pricing plan.

Monitor APIs and endpoints at scheduled intervals. Receive reports about whether tests pass or fail, and view statistics about API and endpoint performance.

See xref:api-functional-monitoring::afm-in-anypoint-platform.adoc[API Functional Monitoring in Anypoint Monitoring].

[[billing]]
== Anypoint Monitoring Packages and Plans

Anypoint Monitoring packages and plans are available:

* <<plans-usage-based>>
* <<plans-legacy>>

[[plans-usage-based]]
=== Anypoint Monitoring Features for Usage-Based Packages (All Regions)

Anypoint Monitoring is the standard method of monitoring Mule app and API performance so that you can more quickly identify and resolve issues. 

* *Anypoint Integration Starter* package is available to all Anypoint Platform regions.
* *Anypoint Integration Advanced* package is available in the https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/monitoring[US] and https://eu1.anypoint.mulesoft.com/monitoring[EU].

All organizations receive fundamental monitoring regardless of pricing model. However, organizations that have the Anypoint Integration Advanced package receive greater storage, guaranteed resources, and advanced capabilities that allow for greater control and flexibility.

If your organization changes its subscription model from the Anypoint Advanced Integration package to the Anypoint Integration Starter package, ensure you have preserved your logs outside of Anypoint Platform. Within an hour of changing pricing models, MuleSoft clears the storage that formerly kept log data.

include::reuse::partial$billing/pricing.adoc[tag=monitoringTable]

[[plans-legacy]]
=== Anypoint Monitoring Features for Legacy Subscription-Based Plans (US and EU Regions)

Anypoint Monitoring is the standard method of monitoring Mule app and API performance so that you can more quickly identify and resolve issues. All organizations receive fundamental monitoring capabilities with their subscriptions. However, customers subscribing at the Titanium tier receive greater storage, guaranteed resources, and advanced capabilities that allow for greater control and flexibility.

If your organization changes its subscription model from a Titanium to a Gold or Platinum subscription, ensure you have preserved your logs outside of Anypoint Platform. Within an hour of changing subscription models, MuleSoft clears the storage that formerly kept log data.

== Use Cases

The following use cases provide examples of how you can use Anypoint Monitoring.

* Understand performance-related KPIs +
DevOps engineer Gary maintains a series of APIs related to a transaction processing system. Because the TPS requires swift response time, Gary uses API response time dashboards and alerts to send an email when there is a bottleneck. After gathering some data, Gary can then size his apps.

* Plan resource allocation across the app network +
IT specialist Peyton uses Anypoint Visualizer to view their app network. For CloudHub and Anypoint Runtime Fabric apps, Peyton sees CPU and memory utilization and idle capacity using integrated Anypoint Monitoring.

* Pinpoint root causes of issues +
Support team member Darius receives a call that the system is running slowly. He examines dashboards and checks response times, failed requests, and so on. He identifies that the backend is not scaling for the number of requests; he can add capacity for Mule apps, or he can throttle requests for other backend issues.

* Measure API trends +
Architect Kara monitors several APIs using dashboards, and she reports API call trends to leadership. She creates a dashboard that shows her top 10 API’s trends per month so she can easily identify APIs that have high volumes of calls or issues.

* Assess the stability of APIs +
Operations administrator Vic can periodically assess the error rate and success rate of key APIs using aggregated views and computations in Anypoint Monitoring. Based on their observations, Vic can stabilize or redesign apps that perform poorly.

* Analyze logs +
Support engineer Carole searches through Anypoint Monitoring logs and notices some apps frequently have errors. She uses this data to create dashboards for areas that have frequent issues, and she creates a plan to improve end processes based on the types of errors identified in the logs.

* Visualize regional or project-based consumption +
Business owner Devon has apps across different runtime planes. He has aggregated dashboards of the regional or project-specific apps, and he can easily determine what is consuming the most resources and evangelize accordingly.
