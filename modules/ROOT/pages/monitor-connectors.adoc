= Monitor Connectors

You can view performance metrics for supported connectors in your application such as what operation is being performed, how long the operations are taking, and whether they are succeeding or failing.

include::reuse::partial$billing/pricing.adoc[tag=featureAdvReq]

You also need the Unified Agent.

== Supported Mule Versions

To monitor connectors, you must use a supported version of Mule:

* Hybrid apps running on Mule 4.2.0, 4.1.x, 3.9.x, or 3.8.7
* CloudHub apps running on Mule 4.1.x or later
* CloudHub 2.0 apps running on Mule 4.3 or later

If your app is using Java 17, you must specify the version during deployment. For a list of compatible connectors, see https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?language=en_US&id=000782248&type=1[Java 17 Compatible Anypoint Connectors].
