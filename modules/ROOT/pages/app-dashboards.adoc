endif::[]

Built-in dashboards display deployment information about your application at the top of the screen and provide access to a number of different graphs, for example:

image::dashboard-built-in-info.png[Deployment Info on an App in a Built-In Dashboard]

The graphs and tables in built-in dashboards support a number of metrics, including application metrics. The *Overview* tab provides overall measures. You can view more granular application metrics through the *Inbound*, *Outbound*, and *Failure* tabs.

Example use cases for monitoring are end-to-end tracing of API calls and dependency analyses to help you isolate the source of issues. For example, you can track response times at each endpoint (outbound or inbound).

.Example: Average Response Time Grouped by Endpoint Outbound
image::dashboard-outbound-response-table.png[Average Response Time Grouped By Endpoint Outbound]

* Infrastructure-level and JVM metrics
* Performance metrics that break down inbound and outbound response times into averages and percentiles

When converting quantities of memory, Anypoint Monitoring uses the power of 10 (_MB_) to reflect metrics values rather than the power of 2 (_MiB_).

== Supported Versions of Mule Runtime Engine

include::partial$include-supported-mule-runtime-version.adoc[]

== Anypoint Monitoring Metrics and Cloudwatch

Anypoint Monitoring collects some metrics that are also collected using Cloudwatch in Anypoint Runtime Manager. Anypoint Monitoring shows data that is aggregated in one minute intervals, and it is possible that data shown in Cloudwatch does not match based on when the data is collected.

== View a Built-in Dashboard

Built-in and custom dashboards are available from Anypoint Monitoring. You can view application metrics for applications deployed to CloudHub and to hybrid targets in both built-in and custom dashboards.

The total number of collections that have occurred, grouped by worker.

Garbage Collection Time::
The approximate accumulated JVM garbage collection time elapsed, grouped by worker.

ParNew Collection Count::
The total number of ParNew garbage collections, grouped by worker.

ParNew Collection Time::
The approximate accumulated ParNew garbage collection time elapsed, grouped by worker.

Classes Loaded::
The total number of loaded classes, grouped by worker.

Classes Loaded Total::
The number of classes loaded since JVM start, grouped by worker.

Classes Unloaded::
The total number of classes unloaded since JVM start, grouped by worker.

Heap Committed::
The amount of heap memory committed by the JVM, grouped by worker.

Heap Used::
The amount of heap memory utilized by the JVM, grouped by worker.

Thread Count::
The total number of threads of the JVM, grouped by worker.

JVM Uptime::
The time elapsed since the JVM started, grouped by worker.

Par Eden Space graphs (Used, Max, Init, and Committed)::
The memory metrics for JVM Par Eden space, grouped by worker.

Par Survivor Space graphs (Used, Max, Init, and Committed)::
The memory metrics for JVM Par Survivor space, grouped by worker.

Metaspace graphs (Used, Max, Init, Committed)::
The memory metrics for JVM metaspace, grouped by worker.

Code Cache graphs (Used, Max, Init, Committed)::
The memory metrics for JVM code cache, grouped by worker.

Compressed Class Space graphs (Used, Max, Init, Committed)::
The memory metrics for JVM compressed class, grouped by worker.

Tenured graphs (Used, Max, Init, Committed)::
The memory metrics for JVM tenured space, grouped by worker.

Committed Virtual Memory::
The amount of virtual memory guaranteed to be available to the running process, grouped by worker.
+
This metric is available only for organizations that have a Titanium subscription.

[[infrastructure-charts]]
== Infrastructure

The following charts appear on the *Infrastructure* dashboard:

JVM - CPU % Utilization::
The average percentage of CPU utilized by the JVM, grouped by worker. The JVM used in this chart is the Mule JVM process. The calculation for CPU utilization is relative to the physical server on which the Mule runtime is deployed. For example, in RTF, the resource usage here indicates the JVM's utilization with respect to the entire server and not with respect to the pod maximum CPU allocation.

JVM - Heap Used::
The average amount of heap memory utilized by the JVM, grouped by worker. The JVM used in this chart is the Mule runtime JVM process.

Total System Processors::
The number of CPU processors available to the Java virtual machine for each worker.

System Memory::
The amount of system memory available for workers over time.

JVM Thread Count::
The average number of threads of the JVM, grouped by worker.

System CPU % Utilization::
The percentage of CPU used by all processes. This metric often aligns with the Cloudwatch System CPU % metric, but there may be different values given the timing of data aggregation for Anypoint Monitoring metrics.
+
This metric is available only for organizations that have a Titanium subscription.

JVM CPU Time::
The cumulative CPU time consumed by the JVM.
+
This metric is available only for organizations that have a Titanium subscription.

Operating System Swap Space::
The amount of memory the system is swapping, grouped by worker in automatic intervals.
+
This metric is available only for organizations that have a Titanium subscription.

[[custom-metrics-charts]]
== Custom Metrics

The *Custom metrics* tab displays only if you have a Titanium subscription and select an app running on a supported version of Mule. See xref:anypoint-custom-metrics-connector.adoc[Anypoint Custom Metrics Connector].

[[application-network]]
== Application Network

The *Application Network* tab displays only if you have a Titanium subscription and have set up Anypoint Visualizer.

Setup requirements change based on your app deployment. Some deployment types require you to enable header injection or modify how Anypoint Visualizer collects data. For more information, see the documentation for each deployment type:

* xref:visualizer::cloudhub-setup.adoc[CloudHub Setup]
* xref:visualizer::runtime-fabric-setup.adoc[Runtime Fabric Setup]
* xref:visualizer::standalone-mule-setup.adoc[Standalone Mule Setup]

The chart on the *Application Network* tab shows the xref:visualizer::troubleshooting-visualization.adoc[Troubleshooting visualization] for the selected app, which must be started. The chart shows only direct callers and callees for the selected app. The connections are based on the selected time range, with a max of the most recent seven days.

You can click *Metrics* to see statistics, such as average response time and failures, related to the app you selected. For more information about metrics in Anypoint Visualizer, see xref:visualizer::troubleshooting-visualization.adoc#choosing-your-metric[Choosing Your Metric].
