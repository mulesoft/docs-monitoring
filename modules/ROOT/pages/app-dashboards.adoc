endif::[]

Built-in dashboards display deployment information about your application at the top of the screen and provide access to a number of different graphs, for example:

image::dashboard-built-in-info.png[Deployment Info on an App in a Built-In Dashboard]

The graphs and tables in built-in dashboards support a number of metrics, including application metrics. The *Overview* tab provides overall measures. You can view more granular application metrics through the *Inbound*, *Outbound*, and *Failure* tabs.

Example use cases for monitoring are end-to-end tracing of API calls and dependency analyses to help you isolate the source of issues. For example, you can track response times at each endpoint (outbound or inbound).

.Example: Average Response Time Grouped by Endpoint Outbound
image::dashboard-outbound-response-table.png[Average Response Time Grouped By Endpoint Outbound]

* Infrastructure-level and JVM metrics
* Performance metrics that break down inbound and outbound response times into averages and percentiles

[[custom-metrics-charts]]
== Custom Metrics

The *Custom metrics* tab displays only if you have a Titanium subscription and select an app running on a supported version of Mule. See xref:anypoint-custom-metrics-connector.adoc[Anypoint Custom Metrics Connector].

[[application-network]]
== Application Network

The chart on the *Application Network* tab shows the xref:visualizer::troubleshooting-visualization.adoc[Troubleshooting visualization] for the selected app, which must be started. The chart shows only direct callers and callees for the selected app. The connections are based on the selected time range, with a max of the most recent seven days.

You can click *Metrics* to see statistics, such as average response time and failures, related to the app you selected. For more information about metrics in Anypoint Visualizer, see xref:visualizer::troubleshooting-visualization.adoc#choosing-your-metric[Choosing Your Metric].

[[automatic-interval]]
== How Data is Aggregated in Intervals

Anypoint Monitoring aggregates data in charts based on the selected time interval. As such, the number of data points shown in a chart varies based on your selected time interval.

[[endpoint-operation-metrics]]
== How Endpoint and Operation Use Metrics Are Gathered

Anypoint Monitoring collects top occurring endpoints or operations for each data collection interval. Endpoints or operations that are not top occurring are sorted into a group called *Other*.

In each data collection interval, top occurring endpoints or operations vary. An endpoint or operation that is top occurring in one interval may not be top occurring in the next.

In Anypoint Monitoring charts and tables, the data comes from multiple data collection intervals. As a result, aggregated data shown in the dashboard is an estimation since the intervals may not have the same top occurring endpoints or operations. The tables show approximate counts for the most commonly occurring endpoints or operations when the *Other* grouping appears.

For example, when an endpoint occurs more often than other endpoints in one interval but occurs less often in another interval (thus sorting it into the *Other* group for that interval), the resulting table displays lower than actual values for that endpoint, since the metrics that do not appear are grouped into the *Other* group.
