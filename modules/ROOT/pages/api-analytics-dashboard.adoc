= API Analytics Dashboards

The API analytics dashboards provide charts to monitor API usage, which gives you insight into how your APIs are used and how they are performing.

If you have xref:api-manager::api-auto-discovery-new-concept.adoc[enabled API auto-discovery], your API metrics are available in the API analytics dashboards in Anypoint Monitoring.

The API analytics dashboard includes two views: enhanced metrics and basic metrics.
The enhanced metrics view includes detailed information about your APIs, and charts are sorted into dashboards based on the type of data displayed.
To get the most out of Anypoint Monitoring, use the enhanced metrics view to see information related to your APIs.

By default, the enhanced metrics view is selected. To switch views, select *Switch to classic metrics*. From the classic metrics view, select *Show new metrics view*.

Charts displaying the `Last 1 hour` label show data that was collected during the past 60 minutes, starting with the current time.

[NOTE]
For Gold and Platinum subscriptions, Anypoint Monitoring retains API analytics metrics data for 30 days. API Manager retains API analytics metrics data for 30 days.

== Anypoint Monitoring Archive API

You can access API analytics metrics data directly via the Anypoint Monitoring Archive API. Using this API, you can navigate and discover your API metrics data using a directory hierarchy.

The Anypoint Monitoring Archive API enables you to download files that contain https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/exchange/portals/anypoint-platform/f1e97bc6-315a-4490-82a7-23abe036327a.anypoint-platform/anypoint-monitoring-archive-api/minor/1.0/pages/Metric%20Data/[JSON objects] that represent one or more metric events. You can also write an application to navigate the data collected by the API and integrate it into your own system.

You can also enable non-aggregated API events by setting this property: `anypoint.platform.config.analytics.agent.api_raw_metrics.enabled=true`.
These events contain more detailed information about each API invocation and can be accessed using the Anypoint Monitoring Archive API under the `raw` file type.

For more information about this API, see the https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/exchange/portals/anypoint-platform/f1e97bc6-315a-4490-82a7-23abe036327a.anypoint-platform/anypoint-monitoring-archive-api/minor/1.0/pages/home/[Anypoint Monitoring Archive API] page in Anypoint Exchange.
