= Set up Advanced Alerts for Graphs in Custom Dashboards

You must have a Titanium subscription to use this feature.

You can set up advanced alerts to trigger email notifications when a data point you are measuring passes a specified threshold. Advanced alerts are listed in the *Alerts* page in Anypoint Monitoring.

When you configure an advanced alert for a graph, an alert state icon appears at the top-left corner of the graph.

Alert states are defined as follows:

include::partial$include-alert-state.adoc[leveloffset=+1]

For example, the green dot in the bell indicates that the state is `OK`:

Note that hovering over the bell icon triggers a description popup. In this case, the description indicates `Status OK`.
