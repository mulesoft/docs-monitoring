The *Access Management* section of Anypoint Platform enables you (as an Organization Administrator) to control user access to dashboards, reports, and metrics by providing two predefined product-specific permissions:

* Anypoint Monitoring Administrator. Allows users to view, create, modify, and delete all content in Anypoint Monitoring.
+
* Anypoint Monitoring Viewer. Allows users to view but not modify content in Anypoint Monitoring.
