The Anypoint Monitoring aggregates your log files so you can manage, search for,
filter, and analyze your logs. You can use aggregated logs in conjunction with
monitoring to help identify causes and investigate failures quickly.

== Searching Logs

You can search for text in logs in a couple of ways:

* Typing your search query into the search field.
+
You can provide full terms, such as `"code 400"` to find  bad requests. For
exact matches to multi-worded searches, you need to surround your search terms
in quotation marks. Here are results from a `"code 400"` search:
+
image::log-search-string.png[Log Search]
+
You can also provide wildcards such as `payload=org.glassfish.grizzly*`. Here
are the results of that search:
+
image::log-search-wildcard.png[Log Search Using a Wildcard]
+
* Using Add A Filter to create a query that you can save as a filter.
** You can create a query from predefined filters and operators, for example:
+
.Using Search Filter Values
image::log-filter-timestamp.png[Using a Filter Query]
+
See <<filters_predefined>> and <<operators>>.
+
** You can create an Elasticsearch query.
+
Note that the UI can convert a query into an Elasticsearch Query DSL
for you. This example shows a query for log-level INFO:
+
.Edit Query DSL (Elasticsearch Query)
[source,text,linenums]
----
{
  "query": {
    "match": {
      "log-level": {
        "query": "INFO",
        "type": "phrase"
      }
    }
  }
}
----
+
The Elasticsearch query UI provides a link to the query documentation so that you can perform more complex queries than otherwise available, for example:
+
.More Complex Elasticsearch Query
[source,text,linenums]
----
{
  "query": {
    "range": {
      "workerId": {
        "gte": 0,
        "lte": 20
      }
    }
  }
}
----
+
Note that some complex Elasticsearch queries do not have an equivalent in the Search Filter Values UI, so you can only create and view such queries in the Elasticsearch query UI.

== Viewing Log Data

By default, the logs entries in your log search results are abbreviated. You can expand and view the log message and details as a table or in JSON format.

image::log-expanded.png[To Expand a Log Message]

=== Tabular Logs

This example shows and expanded log entry as a table. The table contains log filter fields that you see in the Quick Filter list.

=== JSON-Formatted Logs

//TODO: SAY SOMETHING ABOUT THE ADDITIONAL FIELDS IN JSON?

This example shows an expanded log entry in JSON format.

[[view_logs]]
=== Viewing Full Logs on a Dedicated Page

After finding a log on a particular issue, you can view the complete log on a dedicated page (without the quick filters, search field, and filter tags). You can view this detail in tabular or JSON format.

. From the selected log, click the View This Log.
+
.Example: Selected Log
image::logs-view-surrounding.png[View This Log]
+
. View the extended log in tabular or JSON format.
+
.Example: Tabular Format
image::logs-view-extended.png[Viewing Extended Logs]

== Viewing Surrounding Logs

After finding a log on a particular issue that interests you, you might want to know what other log reports preceded or followed it.

. From the selected log, click View Surrounding Logs.
+
image::logs-view-surrounding.png[View Surrounding Logs tab]
+
. Load the number of logs that you want to see before and after the selected log, or use the default.
+
image::logs-set-surrounding.png[View Surrounding Logs]

The default settings:

* Load 5 More newer logs
* Load 5 More older logs

== Working with Predefined Filters

When the Quick Filter list is open, you can select and use predefined log
filters it. This example selects the ERROR log level.

image::log-filter-select.png[Predefined Log Filter]

After you select a predefined filter from the Quick Filter list, you see it
near the top of the page, next to `+Add a Filter`.

image::log-filter-actions.png[Filter Actions]

When you mouse over a filter, you can click a button for any of these actions:

//TODO: ADD DESCRIPTIONS
* Check (enable) or uncheck (disable) the filter.
* Pin or unpin the filter.
* Invert the search filter. For example, if the search is `log level IS ERROR`,
the inversion is `log level IS NOT ERROR`
* Delete the filter.
* Edit the filter configuration.


=== Adding Filter Columns to Logs

You can add or remove a filter column (field) to your log results from the Quick Filters list. For example, you might add the Log Level, Timestamp, or Environment field.

You simply click the column icon for a filter field, for example:

image::log-filter-add-field.png[To Add a Filter Column to the Logs]

The resulting `log-level` column looks like this in the logs:

image::log-filter-column.png[Filter Column in the Logs]

To remove the filter column, simply click column icon for the filter field,
for example:

image::log-filter-remove-field.png[To Remove a Filter Column from the Logs]

You can also remove it with the <<column_move, X icon>> that appears when you scroll over the column.

[[column_move]]
== Moving Filter Columns

To move filter columns in your log results to the left or right, you simply scroll over the column heading and use the arrow icons.

image::log-filter-column-move.png[To Remove a Filter Column from the Logs]

[[filters_predefined]]
=== Search Filters

In addition to using predefined filters, you can create, define, and use your
own filter to use when searching for logs that are important to your
organization.

[[operators]]
=== Operators

You can use these operators when creating a search filter. For example `log-level IS`

|===
| `is` | Available to all filters.
| `is not` | Available to all filters.
| `is between` | Available to `timestamp`.
| `is not between` | Available to `timestamp`.

== Getting the Log Count Over Time

The logs display the count of logs received over a configurable time period.

.Example: Automated Time Period
image::log-graph.png[Log Count (Automated)]

.Example: Selected Time Period
image::log-graph2.png[Log Count (Selected Time Period)]
////

== Filtering Based on the Entire Log Field Value

You can use the funnel-shaped icons on any log in your results to create and remove a filter for the entire log field value.

image::log-filter-create-funnel.png[Creating a Log Message Filter]

The filter you create is visible as a filter tag in the Filters area at the top of the page, for example:

image::log-filter-tag.png[Log Message Filter Tag]

You can edit and use that filter like any other filter. See <<filters_predefined>>.

== Sharing Logs

You can share the URL to your logs.

. From Logs, click the three vertical dots on the top-right of the screen.
+
image::logs-sharing.png[Sharing Logs]
+
. Select Share to load the URL of your log page to a Share Logs Search Link field.
+
image::logs-sharing-url.png[Sharing Logs Link]
+
. Click Copy so you can use it.

[[save_view_log_searches]]
== Saving and Viewing Saved Log Searches

You can save and view log searches.

image::logs-search-save-menu.png[Save Log Search Menu]

After saving a search, you can use View Saved Searches from the same menu to view and delete saved searches, for example:

image::logs-search-save-view.png[View Saved Log Search]

To return to the main Logs page, click View Saved Searches again.

== Clearing a Search

You can clear the current search from the same menu shown in <<save_view_log_searches>>:

. Click Save Search.
. Select Clear Current Search.
