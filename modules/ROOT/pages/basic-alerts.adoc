= Set Up Basic Alerts for Servers, Mule Apps, and APIs

You can set up basic alerts to trigger email notifications when a metric you are measuring passes a specified threshold.

You can create basic alerts for the following metrics:

* For on-premises servers, server groups, server clusters, and apps deployed to Anypoint Runtime Fabric or CloudHub:
** CPU utilization
** Memory utilization
** Thread count
* For hybrid, Anypoint Runtime Fabric, and CloudHub apps:
** Message count
** Message error count
** Message response time
* For APIs:
** Total request count
** Average response time
** Response codes
** Policy violations

A basic alert typically triggers an e-mail within 5 to 15 minutes of an incident. However, the basic alert's timestamp reflects the actual time of the incident.

== Create a Basic Alert

When you create a basic alert, you can select a source for the basic alert, configure the condition under which the basic alert is triggered, and specify which email addresses receive notifications for basic alert triggers.

To create a basic alert:

. Navigate to Anypoint Monitoring.
. Click the *Alerts* tab.
. Click the *+ New Alerts* button.
. Click *Basic alert*.
. In the *Add basic alert* window, enter the information required to create your basic alert:

* *Alert name*
+
Unique and meaningful name for the alert
+
*Name* is limited to 256 characters.
* *Severity level*
+
Severity of the alert: *Critical*, *Warning*, or *Info*
See <<alert-severity>>.
+
* *Source type*
+
Source of the alert: an application, server, or API
+
* *Environment name*
+
Name of the environment where the resource is deployed
+
* *Resource name* (apps), *Server name* (servers), *API* (APIs)
+
Application, server, or API to apply the alert to
* *Metric*
+
Condition that triggers the alert
+
See <<alert-conditions>>.
* *Subject*
+
Subject of the alert email to send when the alert is triggered
+
The subject can include variables.
See <<alert-variables>>.

* *Message*
+
Body text for the email to send when the alert is triggered
+
The message body can include variables.
See <<alert-variables>>.

* *Recipients*
+
Recipients of the alert email
+
You can select up to 20 platform user IDs and enter up to 20 email addresses.
. Click *Create*.

[[alert-severity]]
=== Alert Severity

The following levels of severity are available for basic alerts:

include::partial$include-alert-severity.adoc[leveloffset=+1]

[[alert-conditions]]
=== Alert Conditions

For basic alerts, alert conditions consist of a metric, an operator, and a period of time that the condition is met.

==== Application Metrics

The following metrics are available if your alert is created for an application:

Message count::
Total number of Mule messages that are processed successfully

Message error count::
Number of Mule messages that return an exception in a flow

Message response time::
Response time (in milliseconds) of a message

CPU utilization::
Percent of CPU used
+
This metric is available only for apps deployed to CloudHub or Anypoint Runtime Fabric.

Memory utilization::
Percent of heap used
+
This metric is available only for apps deployed to CloudHub or Anypoint Runtime Fabric.

Thread count::
Total number of threads used
+
This metric is available only for apps deployed to CloudHub or Anypoint Runtime Fabric.

==== Server Metrics

The following metrics are available if your alert is created for a server, server group, or server cluster:

CPU utilization::
Percent of CPU used

Memory utilization::
Percent of memory used

Thread count::
Total number of threads used

==== API Metrics

The following metrics are available if your alert is created for an API:

Total request count::
Sum of requests in the selected time period for the given API.
+
Data is aggregated in one minute increments.

Average response time::
Average response time of requests in the selected time period for the given API.
+
Data is aggregated in one minute increments.

Response codes::
Sum of HTTP response codes that occur in the selected time period.
+
Select up to ten of the following codes: 301, 400, 401, 402, 403, 404, 405, 408, 409, 410, 411, 412, 413, 415, 416, 417, 420, 422, 429, 500, 502, 503, 504, 504, 510, 511

Policy violation::
Sum of requests that return policy violations that you select in the alert condition.
+
Select a policy associated with the selected API. If the selected API does not have policies, the list is empty.

==== Operator

The _operator_ portion of the alert condition is the logic that is used against the metric you are measuring. The following operators are available:

* Above
* Above or equal
* Equal
* Below or equal
* Below

==== Time Period

The _time period_ specifies the duration for which the metric remains valid, based on the criteria defined using the operator and chosen value. A basic alert is triggered only if the metric continuously (not cumulatively) meets the condition for the selected time period. The following time periods are available:

* 5 minutes
* 10 minutes
* 15 minutes
* 20 minutes

== Basic Alert Email Template

You can use the following variables in a basic alert email *Subject* and *Message* fields.
For the description of each variable, see <<alert-variables>>.
