Once you set up alerts for graphs in custom dashboards, you can enable or disable any of them, filter alerts based on the <<alert_status, alert status>>, and link out to the graph in a custom dashboard that is associated with the alert.

== Filtering Alerts by Alert Status

You can filter alerts based on status.

[[alert_status]]
Alert status filters:

* *All states*
* *No data*: No data is available in the series to evaluate the alert threshold.
* *Disabled*: The alert is disabled.
* *Alerting*: The value of the metric is above the threshold.
* *OK*: The value of the metric is below the threshold.
* *Pending*: The alert is enabled and waiting for evaluation.

== Enabling and Disabling Alerts

You can activate or deactivate an alert by toggling the <<alerts, switch>> on the right.

* Enabling a disabled alert causes the alert to transition to *Pending* until it is time for evaluation. Depending on the value, the alert transitions to *OK* or *Alerting*.
* Disabling an alert causes the alert to transition to *Disabled*.
