= Configure and Enable Anypoint Monitoring for Mule Apps (CloudHub)

To start monitoring Mule apps that are managed in CloudHub, you must deploy them to a supported version of Mule runtime engine and set the runtime version in your Mule app.

[NOTE]
Anypoint Monitoring is enabled by default for all CloudHub 2.0 applications.

== Supported Versions of Mule Deployed to CloudHub

include::partial$include-supported-mule-runtime-version.adoc[]

Anypoint Monitoring with Mule runtime engine images receive patch updates as soon as they are available. Because Anypoint Monitoring -AM images are no longer receiving patch updates, switch to a Mule runtime engine (non-AM) image if your production environment requires a Mule runtime engine patch.

// -AM  note removal here?

Metrics and logs are supported in the following Mule versions:

* 4.x.x
* 3.9.x
* 3.8.7

Metrics are used by graphs and other charts within xref:dashboards.adoc[Dashboards].

== Set the Runtime Version

To set or change the runtime version for your Mule app:

* For new and existing Mule apps:
+
. Go to *Settings* in Runtime Manager for that app.
. Choose the new runtime from the *Runtime Version* selector.
+
If you do not see a supported runtime version in the drop-down menu, scroll down
to *Show Old Patch Releases*, click, and select a runtime for your app.
+
* For Anypoint CLI deployments:
+
If you are using the Anypoint CLI to deploy your Mule app (for example,
through a build pipeline), you need to include the `--runtime` parameter with
an appropriate value, for example:
+
[src,command,linenums]
----
anypoint-cli --username="..." --password="..."
 --organization="Mythical, Inc"
 --environment="Production" runtime-mgr cloudhub-application deploy
 --runtime="3.9.4" helloworld ~/demoproj2.zip
----
+
* For Maven deployments:
+
If you are using Maven for deployment, you must modify the `<muleVersion>`
tag in the `pom.xml` file. For example, you can change `<muleVersion>3.9.3</muleVersion>` to `<muleVersion>3.9.4</muleVersion>`).

== Enable Monitoring by Default for New Apps

If you want your Mule apps to be monitored by default when you deploy them to CloudHub, configure this feature in Anypoint Monitoring before you deploy your apps. 
include::reuse::partial$billing/pricing.adoc[tag=enabledFeature]

To configure automatic monitoring for each Mule app as it is deployed to CloudHub:

include::partial$include-nav-steps-no-permissions.adoc[]

. In the Anypoint Monitoring navigation menu, click *Settings*:
. Select *CloudHub*.
. Select *Enable Anypoint Monitoring for newly deployed CloudHub applications*.

If you deployed Mule apps to CloudHub before you enabled this feature, you must enable monitoring for those apps manually. This feature does not retroactively enable monitoring for previously deployed apps.

== Enable Monitoring for Apps Previously Deployed to CloudHub

You can enable monitoring for Mule apps running on non-AM versions of Mule in the Anypoint Monitoring *Settings* page, the application's *Settings* page, or by using the Anypoint CLI for continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD).

For supported versions of Mule, see xref:configure-monitoring-cloudhub.adoc[Configure Anypoint Monitoring for Mule Apps].

=== Enable Monitoring for an App in Monitoring Settings

Use the *Settings* page in Anypoint Monitoring to enable or disable monitoring for apps deployed to CloudHub and running on Mule:

include::partial$include-nav-steps-no-permissions.adoc[]

. In the Anypoint Monitoring navigation menu, click *Settings*:
. Select *CloudHub*.
. In the *Environment* list, select the environment where the application is running. 
+
A list of running applications is shown for the selected environment. 
+
You can search for a specific application using the *List of resources* search box.
. Next to the application, click *Enable* to enable monitoring for the application.

=== Enable Monitoring for an App in Runtime Manager Settings

Enable monitoring for Mule apps running on supported versions of Mule by adding a property to an application deployed to CloudHub:

. Log in to Anypoint Platform.
. In the navigation bar or the main Anypoint Platform screen, click *Runtime Manager*.
. In the list of applications, select the application for which you want to enable monitoring.
The application must be deployed to CloudHub and running on a supported version of Mule.
. In the navigation menu, click *Settings*.
. Click *Properties*, and add the following property: +
`anypoint.platform.config.analytics.agent.enabled=true`
+
image::enable-monitoring-cloudhub.png["Runtime Manager application settings window with Properties tab selected"]
+
. Click *Apply Changes*.

=== Enable Monitoring using the Anypoint CLI

Use the Anypoint CLI and set the following property during your CI/CD deployment:
`anypoint.platform.config.analytics.agent.enabled=true`

== Performance Impact

Enabling Anypoint Monitoring can impact CPU utilization and memory utilization, which varies depending upon specific application behavior, such as inbound and outbound call rates.
For a typical application, expected CPU utilization impact is less than 5%.
For an accurate impact analysis specific to your application, test and estimate any performance impact in your pre-production environment prior to enabling monitoring in your production environment.
