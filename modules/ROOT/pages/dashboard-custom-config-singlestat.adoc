Custom dashboards in Anypoint Monitoring provide a way for you to configure singlestat charts for a single measure, such as a response time or heap usage, of your Mule app environment over a given time range.

== Options (Value, Font, Color, Spark Line, Gauge Settings)

The Options tab includes settings for singlestat <<value_singlestat, values>>, <<font_singlestat, fonts>>, <<color_singlestat, coloring>>, <<spark_singlestat, spark lines>>, and <<gauge_singlestat, gauge icon>> settings.

[[value_singlestat]]
=== Value Settings for Singlestats

In the Options configuration tab, you can configure values for your singlestat. Settings include the type of value you want (such as an average), the unit of measure, and others.

2+| Values
| Stat a|

The value displayed by the singlestat. Available Settings:

* Min: Minimum of recorded values for the specified metric.
* Max: Maximum of recorded values for the specified metric.
* Average: Average of the recorded values for the specified metric.
* Current: The current value for the specified metric.
* Total: Sum of recorded values for the specified metric.
* Name: Name of the metric (for example, `worker-0`).
* First: The first recorded value for the specified metric.
* Delta: The total incremental increase in the series.
* Difference: The difference between the Current value (last value) and the First value.
* Range: The difference between Min and Max.
* Time of Last Point: Timestamp of the last reading.
| Prefix | Prepends text to the singlestat value.
| Postfix | Appends text to the singlestat value.
| Unit | Unit of measurement to display with the singlestat value (for example, `percent (0-100)`).
| Decimals | Overrides the automatic decimal precision for the legend and tooltips.

[[color_singlestat]]
=== Coloring and Thresholds (Options Setting)

In the Options configuration tab, you can add color-coded thresholds to a singlestat so that you can see whether it exceeds or falls within expected limits.

[%header,cols="1,4"]
|===
2+| Coloring
| Background | Adds a background color that matches the color  determined by the Thresholds setting.
| Value | For applying a color for the current singlestat value that matches the color determined by the Thresholds setting.
| Thresholds | For setting a threshold using a numeric range such as `10,20` to distinguish values between the two numbers, below left-most number, and above the right-most number.
| Colors | For setting the colors for the values that are below, within, or above the Thresholds settings. You can invert the colors, as needed.
|===

[[spark_singlestat]]
=== Spark Lines (Options Setting)

In the Options configuration tab, you can provide spark line settings for a singlestat.

[%header,cols="1,4"]
|===
2+| Spark Lines
| Show | Checkbox to show or hide the spark line.
| Full Height | For covering the full height of the singlestat.
| Line Color | For selecting the color of the spark line.
| Fill Color | For selecting the color of the area below the spark line.
|===

[[gauge_singlestat]]
=== Gauge (Options Setting)

In the Options configuration tab, you can display an arc-like gauge that represents the value of the singlestat.

[%header,cols="1,4"]
|===
2+| Gauge
| Show | Checkbox for showing or hiding the gauge.
| Min | Sets a minimum value (such as `0` for a gauge that shows a percentage).
| Max | Sets a maximum value (such as `100` for a gauge that shows a percentage).
| Threshold Labels | Checkbox for showing or hiding your Threshold settings.
|===

After you complete your configuration, you can click Save Changes. To exit the configuration and return to the dashboard, simply click the `X`.

== Value Mappings (Labels for Values)

From the Value Mappings configuration tab, you can provide a human-readable label for a summary statistic.

2+| Range to Text Settings
| Value to Text | Maps a number to a textual description, for example: `0` -> `Error`, `1` -> `Success`
| Range to Text | Maps a numeric range to a textual description, for example: From `5` To `10` Text `Warning`
