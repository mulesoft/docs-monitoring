Alerts indicate whether a resource (such as a Mule app) is behaving as expected or exceeding a defined threshold.

You can implement any of several types of alerts. From the *Alerts* page in Anypoint Monitoring, you can create xref:basic-alerts.adoc[basic alerts], or you can access existing alerts for API Manager and Anypoint Runtime Manager.
If you have a Titanium subscription, you can also view, enable, and disable xref:advanced-alerts.adoc[advanced alerts] that are configured for graphs in custom dashboards.

Using Anypoint Monitoring, you can configure two different types of alerts:

* xref:basic-alerts.adoc[Basic alerts] for servers, Mule apps, and APIs
** Limits per organization:
*** Basic alerts for servers and Mule apps: Up to 50 basic alerts for organizations who do not have a Titanium subscription to Anypoint Platform. +
If you have a Titanium subscription, the limit is 100 basic alerts plus 50 alerts per production vCore. For complete details about subscriptions, contact your customer support representative. See also https://www.mulesoft.com/anypoint-pricing[Anypoint Platform pricing].
*** Basic alerts for APIs: Up to six basic alerts per API instance for organizations that do not have a Titanium subscription to Anypoint Platform. +
If you have a Titanium subscription, the limit is ten alerts per API instance.
+
* xref:advanced-alerts.adoc[Advanced alerts] for graphs in custom dashboards in Anypoint Monitoring
** Limit per organization: Up to 20 advanced alerts
+
Note that thresholds are checked every five minutes. The evaluated query is the average value of the metric in the last five minutes. The evaluated metric is the one referenced in the *General* tab for the graph. If the value passes the threshold, the advanced alert is triggered. The advanced alert is triggered only if the alert state changes (from `OK` state to `Alerting` state or vice versa).
* Operational alerts for APIs through API Manager
* Operational alerts for server and app events through Runtime Manager

== Access the Alerts Page

include::partial$include-nav-steps-no-permissions.adoc[]

include::partial$include-nav-alerts.adoc[]

In the *Alerts* page, you can:

* Create basic alerts
* View basic alerts for servers, apps, and APIs +
Note: If you create an alert for an API using the interface in API Manager, the alert does not appear in the *Alerts* page in Anypoint Monitoring.
+
* View advanced alerts for graphs in custom dashboards (Titanium subscription required)
* Enable or disable alerts
* Filter by <<alert_status, alert status>>
* Filter by <<alert_severity, alert severity>>
* Navigate to alert configuration in Runtime Manager and API Manager

=== Filter Alerts by Alert State

[[alert_status]]
Filter alerts based on state using the following filters:

All states::
Lists all alerts

include::partial$include-alert-state.adoc[leveloffset=+1]

=== Filter Alerts by Alert Severity

When you create basic and advanced alerts, you can select the severity for those alerts. The severity indicates how important the alert is for the recipients of the alerts.

[[alert_severity]]
Filter alerts based on severity using the following filters:

All severities::
Lists all severities

Not defined::
Lists alerts that do not have severities assigned

include::partial$include-alert-severity.adoc[leveloffset=+1]

=== Enable and Disable Alerts

You can enable or disable an alert by toggling the <<alerts, switch>> on the right:

* Enabling a disabled alert causes the alert to transition to `Pending` until it is time for evaluation.
+
Depending on the value, the alert transitions to `OK` or `Alerting`.
* Disabling an alert causes the alert to transition to `Disabled`.

== Configure API Manager and Runtime Manager Alerts

From the *Alerts* page in Anypoint Monitoring, you can access configuration pages for API Manager and Runtime Manager alerts.

Depending on your subscription level:

* If no alerts are set up, you might see links for API and runtime alert setup:
+
image::alerts-setup.png[API and Runtime Alert Setup, 75%, 75%]
+
** API operational alerts
+
For guidance about alerts in API Manager, see xref:2.x@api-manager::using-api-alerts.adoc[About API Alerts]. Note that these alerts are not listed in the *Alerts* page for Anypoint Monitoring.
** Runtime Manager operational alerts
+
For guidance about alerts in Runtime Manager, see xref:runtime-manager::alerts-on-runtime-manager.adoc[About Configuring Alerts Using Runtime Manager]. Note that these alerts are not listed in the *Alerts* page for Anypoint Monitoring.
* If you do not have a Titanium subscription, you might see *https://www.mulesoft.com/anypoint-pricing[Titanium subscription required]*.

Instead of seeing links to API and runtime alerts, you receive visual guidance showing how to open the configuration area for alerts in graphs for custom dashboards:

== Add API Manager and Runtime Manager Alerts

Click *+ New alert* to access API Manager and Runtime Manager alert configuration pages. You can also get basic instructions for configuring alerts for a chart (widget) in a custom dashboard.

Note that you can also select to add or edit an alert from a chart in a custom dashboard:
