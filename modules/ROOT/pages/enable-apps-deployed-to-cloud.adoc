You can enable monitoring for Mule apps running on non-AM versions of Mule in the Anypoint Monitoring *Settings* page, the application's *Settings* page, or by using the Anypoint CLI for continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD).

For supported versions of Mule, see xref:configure-monitoring-cloudhub.adoc[Configure Anypoint Monitoring for Mule Apps].

== Enable Monitoring Using the UI

You can use the *Settings* page in Anypoint Monitoring to enable or disable apps deployed to CloudHub and running on Mule.

A list of running applications is displayed for the selected environment. +
You can search for a specific application using the *List of resources* search box.
. Next to the application, click *Enable* to enable monitoring for the application, or *Disable* to disable monitoring for the application. +
[NOTE]
Applications running on `x.x.x.-AM` versions are displayed in the list and are already enabled, however, you can't disable these applications from this page.

== Enable Monitoring in CloudHub Settings

You can enable monitoring for Mule apps running on supported versions of Mule by adding a property to an application deployed to CloudHub.

. Log in to Anypoint Platform.
. In the navigation bar or the main Anypoint Platform screen, click *Runtime Manager*.
. In the list of applications, select the application for which to enable monitoring. +
The application must be deployed to CloudHub and running on a supported version of Mule.
. In the menu on the left, click *Settings*.
. Click *Properties*, and add the following property: +
`anypoint.platform.config.analytics.agent.enabled=true`
+

+
To disable monitoring, change the value to `false`.
. Click *Apply Changes*.

== Enable Monitoring for CI/CD Deployments

Use the Anypoint CLI and set the following property during your CI/CD deployment:
`anypoint.platform.config.analytics.agent.enabled=true`

== Performance Impact

Enabling Monitoring can impact CPU utilization and memory utilization, which varies depending upon specific application configuration. MuleSoft recommends that you test any performance impact in your pre-production environment prior to enabling monitoring in your production environment to ensure optimal performance and sizing.
