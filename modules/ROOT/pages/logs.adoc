In addition to logging through xref:runtime-manager::viewing-log-data.adoc[Runtime Manager], Anypoint Monitoring aggregates log files so you can manage, search for, filter, and analyze your logs. You can use aggregated logs in conjunction with monitoring to help identify issues and investigate failures quickly. These features support:

* Comparative analysis and identification of event and information patterns based on searches across selected Mule apps and environments.
* Searches within the logs of a specific worker (or set of workers) for a Mule app so that you can narrow scope of issues to check.
* Sharing a snapshot of important logs with developers who can work on the source of the issue.


[CAUTION]
====

*For on-premises servers with customized logging:*

Logs produced by apps with customized logging (by changing the pattern layout in the `log4j2.xml` file) might not get indexed correctly into Anypoint Monitoring. To ensure correct indexing, use the Mule default pattern layout, which is one of the following:

* `<PatternLayout pattern="%-5p %d [%t] [event: %X{correlationId}] %c: %m%n" />`, or
* `<PatternLayout pattern="%d [%t] %-5p %c - %m%n" />`

*For applications deployed to Cloudhub and Anypoint Runtime Fabric with customized time zones:*

Do not override the default JVM timezone for applications deployed to Cloudhub and Anypoint Runtime Fabric with customized time zones. The timezone must be UTC. Changing the timezone to a local timezone causes logs to be indexed in Anypoint Monitoring with incorrect timestamps.

====

== Search Logs

In Anypoint Monitoring, click *Log Search* in the menu on the left. On the log search page, you can search for text in logs in a few different ways. You can type your search query into the search field, you can use the UI to add a filter, and you can create a query.

=== Log Search Query

To search the logs, type your search query into the log search field and press *Enter*.

Provide the exact term you're looking for, such as `"code 400"` to find  bad requests. For
exact matches of more than one word, surround the search term
with quotation marks.

Example results from a `"code 400"` search:

image::log-search-string.png[Log Search]

Use the asterisk wildcard in a search if you don't know the exact term.

Example results from the wildcard search `payload=org.glassfish.grizzly*`:

image::log-search-wildcard.png[Log Search Using a Wildcard]

=== Add a Filter
You can create a filter to search logs using predefined fields, operators, and values.

. Click *+Add a filter*.
. Select the predefined field from the drop-down list. +
  * `application`
  * `class`
  * `environment`
  * `environment type`
  * `log level`
  * `logger`
  * `message`
  * `thread`
  * `timestamp`
  * `worker`
. Select the operator from the drop-down list. +
The available operators change according to the field you select. +
When you select the operator, if a value is required, a *Value* box appears on the right.
. If applicable, enter a value. +
The following image shows an example of using a search filter to search for all logs that have a timestamp that falls between the given dates.
+
image::log-filter-timestamp.png[Using a Filter Query]
+
See <<filters_predefined>> and <<operators>>.
+
. (Optional) Enter a value in *Label*.
. Click *Save*. +
The filter appears to the right of *+Add a filter*.

=== Search Query

To convert a search query into a Query DSL:

. Click *+Add a filter*.
. Click *Edit Query DSL*. +
. Enter your query, and click *Save*. +
This example shows a query for log-level INFO:
+
[source,text,linenums]
----
{
  "query": {
    "match": {
      "log-level": {
        "query": "INFO",
        "type": "phrase"
      }
    }
  }
}
----
+
The search query UI provides a link to the query documentation so that you can perform more complex queries than otherwise available.
+
This example shows a complex query.
[source,text,linenums]
----
{
  "query": {
    "range": {
      "workerId": {
        "gte": 0,
        "lte": 20
      }
    }
  }
}
----

[NOTE]
Some complex search queries do not have an equivalent in the search filter values UI, so you can only create and view such queries in the query UI.

== View Log Data

By default, the log entries in your log search results are abbreviated. You can expand and view the log message and details as a table or in JSON format.

image::log-expanded.png[To Expand a Log Message]

=== Tabular Logs

This example shows an expanded log entry as a table. The table contains log filter fields that you see in the Quick Filter list.

[[view_logs]]
=== View Full Logs on a Dedicated Page

After finding a log on a particular issue, you can view the complete log on a dedicated page (without the quick filters, search field, and filter tags). You can view the log detail in tabular or JSON format.

. From the selected log, click *View This Log*.
+
image::logs-view-surrounding.png[View This Log]
+
. View the extended log in tabular or JSON format.
+
image::logs-view-extended.png[Viewing Extended Logs]

== View Surrounding Logs

After finding a log for a particular issue, you might want to know what other log reports preceded or followed it.

. From the selected log, click *View Surrounding Logs*.
+
image::logs-view-surrounding.png[View Surrounding Logs tab]
+
. Load the number of logs that you want to see before and after the selected log, or use the default.
+
image::logs-set-surrounding.png[View Surrounding Logs]

The default settings are:

* *Load 5 more* newer logs
* *Load 5 more* older logs

== Working with Predefined Filters

When the *Quick Filters* list is open, you can select and use predefined log filters.

[NOTE]
For every result group, the *Quick Filters* list displays the first five results of the most recent 500 log entries. When there are more than 500 entries or the top five values do not represent 100% of total values, a *See More* link for each result group appears. You can click *See More* to open the *Add a Filter* box and set parameters to further filter your results.

This example of a predefined filter selects the ERROR log level.

image::log-filter-select.png[Predefined Log Filter]

After you select a predefined filter from the Quick Filter list, you see it
near the top of the page, next to *Add a Filter*.

image::log-filter-actions.png[Filter Actions]

When you hover over a filter, you can select from the following actions:

* *Enable/Disable* - Enables or disables the filter. When the filter is disabled, it is grayed out.
* *Pin/Unpin* -  Pin or unpin the filter.
* *Invert* -  Change the operation of the search filter. For example, if the search is `log level IS ERROR`,
the inversion is `log level IS NOT ERROR`.
* *Remove* - Delete the filter.
* *Edit* - Change the filter configuration.


=== Adding Filter Columns to Logs

From the Quick Filters list, you can add and remove columns to or from log results. For example, you might add the Log Level, Timestamp, or Environment field.

Click the column icon for a filter field, for example:

image::log-filter-add-field.png[To Add a Filter Column to the Logs]

The resulting `log-level` column looks like this in the logs:

image::log-filter-column.png[Filter Column in the Logs]

To remove the filter column, click the column icon for the filter field,
for example:

image::log-filter-remove-field.png[To Remove a Filter Column from the Logs]

You can also remove it with the <<column_move, X icon>> that appears when you scroll over the column.

[[column_move]]
== Moving Filter Columns

To move filter columns in your log results to the left or right, you simply scroll over the column heading and use the arrow icons.

image::log-filter-column-move.png[To Remove a Filter Column from the Logs]
