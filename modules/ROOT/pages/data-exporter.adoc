== Export Anypoint Platform Data to Third-Party Apps

The Data Exporter feature enables you to export _audit logs_ and _trace data_ to third-party observability and analytics apps, such as Datadog and Splunk.

== Before You Begin

Before you configure data exporter, ensure you have:

* An Anypoint Platform account with the (permission) and (permission) permissions
* The ability to create an access token for your third party app

== Configure Destinations

To begin exporting your data to a third party app, you must establish a connection and authorize data transfers between Anypoint Platform and your third party app. 

== Create a Connection

After you configure a third-party app as a destination, you can create a connection that specifies what type of data the Data Exporter feature sends. You can also configure frequency.
