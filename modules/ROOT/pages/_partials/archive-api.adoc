You can access API analytics metrics data directly via the Anypoint Monitoring Archive API. Using this API, you can navigate and discover your API metrics data using a directory hierarchy.

The Anypoint Monitoring Archive API enables you to download files that contain https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/exchange/portals/anypoint-platform/f1e97bc6-315a-4490-82a7-23abe036327a.anypoint-platform/anypoint-monitoring-archive-api/minor/1.0/pages/Metric%20Data/[JSON objects] that represent one or more metric events. You can write an application to navigate the data collected by the API and integrate it into your own system.

You can also enable non-aggregated API events by setting this property: `anypoint.platform.config.analytics.agent.api_raw_metrics.enabled=true`.
These events contain more detailed information about each API invocation and can be accessed using the Anypoint Monitoring Archive API under the `raw` file type.
