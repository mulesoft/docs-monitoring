To ensure charts are plotted continuously without interruptions, all average response time charts use a straight line to connect the last available value that precedes a period of app or API inactivity with the next available value. To understand activity in average response time charts, consider behavior in related charts, such as request counts, to get a holistic idea of your API or app's activity.
