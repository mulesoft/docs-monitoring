To enable traffic inspection: 

. If an Anypoint Monitoring agent is installed on your server, uninstall the agent and delete its `/am` subfolder:

.. From your Mule home directory (`MULE_HOME`), run the following command to uninstall the agent:
+
----
./bin/uninstall 
----
.. Delete the `/am` subfolder from your Mule home directory.
. Place the Anypoint Monitoring agent zip file (`am-3.x.zip`) to your Mule home directory.
+
The zip is available as part of the closed beta program. 
. Extract the zip file to add the `/am` subfolder to your Mule home directory. 
. From the command line:
.. Navigate to the `/am` subfolder, for example:
+
----
cd am
----
.. Install the agent to your Linux server:
+
----
./bin/install -p http:/proxy-server:port
----
+
Replace `+http:/proxy-server:port+` with the URI of your proxy server and port.
. Restart your server in Runtime Manager.
+
For guidance, see xref:runtime-manager::servers-actions.adoc[]
. Return to your `/am` subfolder and run the setup script:
+
----
./bin/setup
----
. After approximately five minutes, check for your server's metrics in Anypoint Monitoring.
