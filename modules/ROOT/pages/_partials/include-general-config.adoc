= General Settings for Basic and Advanced Data Queries

[[general_settings]]

General settings include <<mode_basic, basic>> and <<mode_advanced, advanced>> queries (or modes) for configuring time-series data. Both configurations share fields for the title and a short description.

Other settings are specific to the setting mode (basic or advanced).

[[mode_basic]]
=== Basic Mode

In the *General* configuration tab, a basic query selects a single metric for a resource (a deployed application or API) in a given environment.

2+| Basic Mode Settings
| Panel Type a|
From the drop-down menu, select the type of panel to display for the resource--*Application Panel* or *API Panel*.

| Metric a|

The drop-down menu includes these types of metrics:

* Inbound response metrics and averages
* JVM metrics
* Outbound response metrics and averages

For a list of basic metrics, see xref:dashboard-config-ref.adoc#metrics[Basic Mode Metrics]

| Environment | The environment where your application or API is deployed.
| Resource | A deployed application or API.

After you complete your configuration, click *Save Changes*. 

To exit the configuration and return to the dashboard, click the *X*.

[[mode_advanced]]
=== Advanced Mode

In the *General* configuration tab, advanced settings support one or more fine-tuned queries for your chart.

[IMPORTANT]
If you switch back to the basic configuration, some of the advanced configuration queries are removed.

2+| Advanced Mode Settings for Applications
| From a|

Lists JVM and Mule app properties (such as `jvm.memory` and `app_inbound_metric`) that you can add to your chart.

Note that the field provides matching suggestions when you type in a character. For example, `jvm.c` will produce a list of all values that contain those characters (such as `jvm.classloading` and `jvm.cpu.operatingsystem`).

For a list of advanced metrics, see xref:dashboard-config-ref.adoc#metrics_advanced[Advanced Mode Metrics]
| Where a|
Supports conditional logic for filtering the From data source you selected.

* You can select one or more filters tags (such as `app_id`, `env_id`, `org_id`, `worker_id`). Example: `Where env_id = Sandbox`.
* Available operators include `=`, `!=`, `<>`, `<`, and `>`.
* You can also construct a query that contains multiple filtering expressions by using logical `AND` or `OR` operators between the expressions.
| Select a|
For creating a function that selects a field (such as  `heap_committed`,`heap_total`, or `heap_used`) from the From data (such as `jvm.memory`) and applies an operation to it (such as the `mean` of the `heap_total`). You can add one or more `field` settings.

//*TODO_VERIFY* Note that when you group by time, you need to use an aggregation function. In addition, some functions like derivatives also require an aggregation function.

| Group By a|

//*TODO_VERIFY*
For grouping the data by a selected time interval (such as `$__interval`, `1s`, `10m`, `1h`), filter tag (such as `tag(env_id)`), and fill options (such as `none`, `null`, `0`, `previous`, `linear`).

Valid values and arguments:

* `time($__interval)` for the automated time interval setting, or you can  specify time intervals of `1s`, `10s`, `1m`, `5m`, `10m`, `15m`, or `1h`.
* `fill()` where valid values are `none`, `null`, `0`, `previous`, `linear`.
* `LIMIT`: Numeric value (N) used to limit the result to the first N data  points (combined series and timestamp values) returned by a query.
* `SLIMIT`: Numeric value (N) used to return the all data points (combined series and timestamp values) from the first N series returned by the query.
* `ORDER BY time DESC`: Returns results in descending time order.
| Alias By | You can create a label for your metric using a literal string (such as `my string`) or supported variables (for example, `$tag_worker_id` or `$tag_env_id`).

Select the field and mean values.

Select the time and fill values.
|Alias by a|

Enter a naming pattern.

TODO /QUESTION: CAN YOU DO Regex matching ON WHERE?
TODO / SELECT:  row you can specify what fields and functions you want to use. If you have a group by time you need an aggregation function. Some functions like derivative require an aggregation function. The editor tries simplify and unify this part of the query. For example:
*TODO: DESCRIPTIONS NEEDED*: Group By.
*TODO: VALID VALUES NEEDED, explain supported variables, too. MK's notes say "Series Name"*
*TODO: NEED DESCRIPTIONS OF MANY OF THESE SETTINGS*

TODO: SEE IF ANY OF THIS COULD GO ABOVE:

|===
| From | Identifies the source of the data to measure in your graph. For example, you might select Mule app (`app`) or Java virtual machine (`jvm`) data, such as `app_inbound_metric`, `app_outbound_metric`, `jvm.classloading`, `jvm.cpu.operatingsystem`, `jvm.garbagecollector.parnew`, `jvm.memory`, `jvm.runtime`, `jvm.threading`, or one of the many other sources.
| Where | For filtering the source based on a given property (such as the organization ID (`org_id`) or environment ID (`env_id`), or both) to which the metric applies. Operators for the properties are `=`, `!=`, `<>` (less than or greater than, but not equal to), `<`, `>` (for example, `env_id = Sandbox`). Available properties also include `app_id`, `endpoint`, `endpoint_type`, `flow_id`, `org_id`, `response_type`, and `worker_id`.
| Select | For manipulating data in one or more fields, such as `avg_request_count` , `avg_response_time`.
