[[general_settings]]

General settings include <<mode_basic, basic>> and <<mode_advanced, advanced>> queries (or modes) for configuring time-series data. Both configurations share fields for the title and a short description.

Other settings are specific to the setting mode (basic or advanced).

[[mode_basic]]
== Basic Mode

In the *General* configuration tab, a basic query selects a single metric for a resource (a deployed application or API) in a given environment.

[%header,cols="1,4"]

2+| Basic Mode Settings
| Panel Type a|
From the drop-down menu, select the type of panel to display for the resource -- `Application Panel`, `API Panel`, or `API Analytics Panel` (deprecated).

| Metric a|

The drop-down menu includes these types of metrics:

* Inbound response metrics and averages
* JVM metrics
* Outbound response metrics and averages

For a list of basic metrics, see xref:dashboard-config-ref.adoc#metrics[Basic Mode Metrics]

| Environment | The environment where your application or API is deployed.
| Resource | A deployed application.

This option is available only if you selected `Application Panel` as your panel type.
| API | A deployed API.

This option is available only if you selected `API Panel` or `API Analytics Panel` (deprecated) as your panel type.
| Version / Instance | The Mule version or instance on which your API is deployed.

This option is available only if you selected `API Panel` or `API Analytics Panel` (deprecated) as your panel type.
|===

After you complete your configuration, click *Save Changes*.

To exit the configuration and return to the dashboard, click the *X*.

[NOTE]
When you create an application panel using a JVM metric, the query that supports the panel uses only the worker-id for the app. When you modify the panel at a later time, the resource fields are populated with the query content. Because some apps share a worker-id, the resource that appears in the selector might appear to be a different resource from the resource you selected originally. However, all resources share the same worker, so the query has the correct information despite the selector displaying a different resource name.

[[mode_advanced]]
== Advanced Mode

In the *General* configuration tab, advanced settings support one or more fine-tuned queries for your chart.

[IMPORTANT]
If you switch back to the basic configuration, some of the advanced configuration queries are removed.

[%header,cols="1,4"]

2+| Advanced Mode Settings for Applications
| From a|

Lists JVM and Mule app properties (such as `jvm.memory` and `app_inbound_metric`) that you can add to your chart.

This field provides matching suggestions when you type in a character. For example, `jvm.c` will produce a list of all values that contain those characters (such as `jvm.classloading` and `jvm.cpu.operatingsystem`).

For a list of advanced metrics, see xref:dashboard-config-ref.adoc#metrics_advanced[Advanced Mode Metrics]
| Where a|
Supports conditional logic for filtering the *From* data source you selected.

* Select one or more filters tags (such as `app_id`, `env_id`, `org_id`, `worker_id`).
* Available operators include: +
 ** `=` The value on the left matches the value on the right.
 ** `!=` The value is not equal to.
 ** `<>` The value is not equal to.
 ** `<` The value on the left is less than the value on the right. 
 ** `>` The value on the left is greater than the value on the right.
* You can also construct a query that contains multiple filtering expressions by using logical `AND` or `OR` operators between the expressions. +
Example: `Where env_id = Sandbox`
| Select a|
Add one or more `field` settings to create a function that selects a field from the *From* data and applies an operation to it (such as the `mean` of the `heap_total`). 

image::config-general-advanced-select.png[Select Options]

//*TODO_VERIFY* Note that when you group by time, you need to use an aggregation function. In addition, some functions like derivatives also require an aggregation function.

| Group By a|

//*TODO_VERIFY*
For grouping the data by a selected time interval (such as `$&#95;interval`, `1s`, `10m`, `1h`), filter tag (such as `tag(env_id)`), and fill options (such as `none`, `null`, `0`, `previous`, `linear`).

Valid values and arguments:

* `time($&#95;interval)` for the automated time interval setting, or you can  specify time intervals of `1m`, `5m`, `10m`, `15m`, or `1h`.
* `fill()` where valid values are `none`, `null`, `0`, `previous`, `linear`.
* `LIMIT`: Numeric value (N) used to limit the result to the first N data  points (combined series and timestamp values) returned by a query.
* `SLIMIT`: Numeric value (N) used to return the all data points (combined series and timestamp values) from the first N series returned by the query.
* `ORDER BY time DESC`: Returns results in descending time order.
| Alias By | You can create a label for your metric using a literal string (such as `my string`) or supported variables (for example, `$tag_worker_id` or `$tag_env_id`).

`http_summary_metric` 

For a list of advanced metrics, see xref:dashboard-config-ref.adoc#metrics_advanced[Advanced Mode Metrics]
| Where a|
Provides conditional logic for filtering the *From* data source you selected.

You can select one or more filter tags (such as `api_id`, `org_id`, `api_version_id`, `method`, `status code`). Example: `Where status_code = 200`.

|Select a|

For creating a function that selects a field (such as `request_size_average`,`response_time_max`, or `response_time_sum`) from the HTTP summary and applies an operation to it (such as the `mean` of the `response_time_average`). You can add one or more `field` settings.
|Group by a|

For grouping the data by a selected time interval (such as `$&#95;interval`, `1s`, `10m`, `1h`), filter tag (such as `tag(api_id)`), and fill options (such as `none`, `null`, `0`, `previous`, `linear`).
|Alias by a|

You can create a label for your metric using a literal string (such as `my string`) or supported variables (for example, `$tag_api_id`). The alias must always begin with `$tag`. The syntax is `$tag_yourTagName`.

To use your tag as an alias, the tag must be used to `group by` in the query.

TODO /QUESTION: CAN YOU DO Regex matching ON WHERE?
TODO / SELECT:  row you can specify what fields and functions you want to use. If you have a group by time you need an aggregation function. Some functions like derivative require an aggregation function. The editor tries simplify and unify this part of the query. For example:
*TODO: DESCRIPTIONS NEEDED*: Group By.
*TODO: VALID VALUES NEEDED, explain supported variables, too. MK's notes say "Series Name"*
*TODO: NEED DESCRIPTIONS OF MANY OF THESE SETTINGS*

TODO: SEE IF ANY OF THIS COULD GO ABOVE:
.Advanced Query Options
|===
| From | Identifies the source of the data to measure in your graph. For example, you might select Mule app (`app`) or Java virtual machine (`jvm`) data, such as `app_inbound_metric`, `app_outbound_metric`, `jvm.classloading`, `jvm.cpu.operatingsystem`, `jvm.garbagecollector.parnew`, `jvm.memory`, `jvm.runtime`, `jvm.threading`, or one of the many other sources.
| Where | For filtering the source based on a given property (such as the organization ID (`org_id`) or environment ID (`env_id`), or both) to which the metric applies. Operators for the properties are `=`, `!=`, `<>` (less than or greater than, but not equal to), `<`, `>` (for example, `env_id = Sandbox`). Available properties also include `app_id`, `endpoint`, `endpoint_type`, `flow_id`, `org_id`, `response_type`, and `worker_id`.
| Select | For manipulating data in one or more fields, such as `avg_request_count` , `avg_response_time`.
