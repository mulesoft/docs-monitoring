The Telemetry Exporter feature currently has the following issues, limitations, and data differences:

* The audit logs that the Telemetry Exporter feature sends to third-party apps often have different field names from the audit logs that appear in Access Management or the Audit Query Log API. +
For example, audit logs shown in the UI or retrieved by the Audit Log Query API describe a user action (such as `update` or `delete`) as `action`, whereas the OpenTelemetry attribute refers to it as `mulesoft.audit.action`.
* If the audit log entry metadata and payload field exceed 30KB when compressed, the payload will be truncated prior to compression.
