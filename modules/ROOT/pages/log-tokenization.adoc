= Log Tokenization

App metrics are collected and forwarded to Anypoint Monitoring, where you can manage and search the logs in the Anypoint Monitoring log management console. Log tokenization provides an extra layer of security for logs that may contain sensitive data. 

Log messages are often difficult to parse in order to apply meaningful tokenization because they can have so many different formats. The tokenization service connector helps you tokenize logs by parsing the unstructured content of logs to find the break points so that log messages can be broken into meaningful tokens. You can leverage the Anypoint Security tokenization service, which runs in Runtime Fabric, to tokenize and detokenize Mule app logs.

== Supported Mule Versions

Log tokenization is supported on:

* Hybrid apps running on Mule 3.x or 4.x
* CloudHub apps running on Mule 3.x or 4.x  

== Prerequisites

. xref:1.13@runtime-fabric::install-create-rtf-arm.adoc[Install Runtime Fabric].
. xref:1.13@runtime-fabric::enable-inbound-traffic.adoc[Enable inbound traffic] on Runtime Fabric. 
. In Anypoint Security, xref:anypoint-security::create-tokenization-format.adoc[create a tokenization format].
. In Runtime Manager, xref:anypoint-security::tokenization-example.adoc[create the tokenization service]. 
. In API Manager, xref:2.x@api-manager::getting-started-proxy.adoc[set up the API gateway] for the Mule app to serve as the proxy.

== Add the Required Components to Your App Flow

To enable log tokenization, you need to create an app flow using Flow Designer or Studio and add the required components. 

. In Flow Designer or Studio, create an app flow for the Mule app. 
. Add the following components to your Mule app flow. +

[%header,cols="a,a"]
|===
|Component |Description
|Logger component | This core component logs important information. You can add the Logger component anywhere in a flow. See xref:mule-runtime::logger-component-reference.adoc[Logger Component].
|Tokenization API a|The Tokenization API allows calls to a configured tokenization service which enables you to substitute a sensitive data element with a non-sensitive equivalent. +
The Tokenization API is available on the MuleSoft public portal. Go to https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/exchange/portals/anypoint-platform/[Anypoint Exchange] and search for "Tokenization API". 

|Log Tokenization connector
|You can find the Log Tokenization connector in *Monitoring > Tools*.
|===
. Once you have configured your app flow, in Anypoint Monitoring, click *Log Search* in the menu on the left. +
On the log search page, you can search for the tokenized values. 
. To detokenize a value, go to API Manager. See xref:2.x@api-manager::policy-mule4-detokenization.adoc[Detokenization Policy] +
[NOTE]
You must have the *Manage Policies* permission to detokenize values. See xref:2.x@api-manager::environment-permission-task.adoc[Granting Permission to Access an Environment]
