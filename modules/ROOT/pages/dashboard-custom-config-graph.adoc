= Configure Graphs in a Custom Dashboard
ifndef::env-site,env-github[]
include::_attributes.adoc[]
endif::[]

In Anypoint Monitoring, you can configure one or more sets of time-series data in a graph. The graph measures the changes to time-series data over time. A graph in a custom dashboard can display a metric for a resource in a given environment. For example, to configure a graph, you might select a response time or heap usage as the metric to graph for a Mule app in your Design or Sandbox environment.

Advanced configuration options allow for more fine-tuned data sets. You can also customize the X and Y axes, the look of the graph, legends, the behavior when you hover over a data point, and more.

To open a configuration page for a graph, see xref:dashboard-custom-config.adoc[Configure Custom Dashboards].

== Axes (X-Axis and Y-Axis Settings)

Configure the x-axis and y-axis of your graph in the *Axes* tab.

=== Y-Axis Settings

Set a vertical y-axis for the left (Left Y) or right (Right Y) side of your graph.

[%header,cols="1,4"]
|===
2+| Y-Axis Settings
| Show | If unchecked, hides the y-axis from the graph.
| Unit | The unit of measurement to use for values on the y-axis.  Values include `none`, data types (such as `short`, `percent (1-100)`), `currency` settings (including `Dollars $` or `Real ($)`), `time`, `data`, `data rate`, and many other types of values.
| Scale a|

Valid values for a linear or logarithmic (log) scale for coordinates on the y-axis:

* linear: For y-coordinates, such as `1`,`2`,`3`.
* log (base 2): For y-coordinates, such as `1`,`4`,`16`.
* log (base 10): For y-coordinates, such as `1`,`10`,`100`.
* log (base 32): For y-coordinates, such as `1`,`32`,`1024`.
* log (base 1024): For y-coordinates, such as `1`,`1024`,`1048576`.
| Y-Min | The minimum value for a y-coordinate. Defaults to `auto`.
| Y-Max | The maximum value for a y-coordinate. Defaults to `auto`.
| Decimals | Override for the automatic decimal precision on y-coordinates, for example, where `2` limits a value of `10.12345` to `10.12`. Defaults to `auto`.
| Label | A string used to label the Y axis. Defaults to `""`.
|===

=== X-Axis Settings

[%header,cols="1,4"]
|===
2+| X-Axis Settings
| Show | If unchecked, hides the x-axis from the graph.
| Mode a|

Valid values:

* Time: The default option. Indicates that x-axis data is divided into time units (for example, hours or minutes).
* Series: Indicates that data divided by series, and the y-axis provides the value of the series data.
* Histogram: Converts the graph into a bar chart that represents collections of data at a specified, numeric intervals (called a buckets or bins), for example, . The higher a bar in a histogram, the greater the frequency (or count) of data collected at that interval.
| Value | Visible only if Series is selected.
| Buckets | Visible only if Histogram is selected. Divides the range of values for a given metric into the specified number of intervals so that the histogram can display the count or frequency of data points that fall into that interval.

| Decimals | Overrides automatic decimal precision used in legends and tooltips
|===

After you complete your configuration, click *Save Changes*.

To exit the configuration and return to the dashboard, click the *X*.

=== Stacking and Hover (Advanced Setting)

In the *Advanced configuration* tab, you can configure a hover tooltip to display information about a data point in a graph when you hover over the value.

image::graph-advanced-stacking-hover.png[Advanced Graph Settings: Stack and Hover]

[%header,cols="1,4"]
|===
2+| Hover Tooltip Settings
| Mode | To display one or all series in the tooltip.
| Sort Order | Displays data in no order (None), Decreasing, or Increasing order. Defaults to None.
| Stacked Value  a|
Available when *Stack* is checked. Controls the display of values in the tooltip.

Valid values are:

* Individual: The value of the series that you hover over.
* Cumulative: Sum of series below the stacked value plus the series you hover over.
|===

Stacking and Null functionality displays multiple series as a group within a stack. You can also specify how to deal with null values.

[%header,cols="1,4"]
|===
2+| Stacking and Null Settings
| Stack | When checked, stacks each series, one on top of another, instead of overlaying them.
| Percent | Available when *Stack* is checked. Displays each series of stacked values as a percentage.
| Null Value | Determines how to display null values: Connected, Null, Null As Zero.
|===

=== Threshold (Advanced Setting)

In the *Advanced* configuration tab, you can set one or more thresholds, such as a line or section to a graph, to indicate whether the data crosses a limit that you specify.

[NOTE]
Thresholds are not available when an alert is in place on the graph. To re-enable thresholds for a chart, you must delete the alert.

image::graph-advanced-threshold.png[Threshold Settings for a Graph]

[%header,cols="1,4"]
|===
2+| Threshold Settings
| `gt` or `lt` | Indicates whether the limit applies to data that is greater than (`gt`) or less than (`lt`) the specified threshold value.
| Threshold value | A numeric value for the threshold.
| Threshold type | Identifier for the threshold (Custom, Critical, Warning, or OK).
| Fill | Adds a filler color to the graph that corresponds to the specified threshold setting.
| Line |  Adds a line to the graph that corresponds to the specified threshold setting.
| Fill Color  | Similar to *Fill* settings, but for custom thresholds only.
| Line Color | Similar to *Line* settings, but for custom thresholds only.
|===

=== Time Range Shift (Advanced Setting)
In the *Advanced* configuration tab, you can set overrides any time intervals or ranges that end users select for the custom dashboard. Such selections are global and apply to all charts in the dashboard. Overrides are useful when the selection does not make sense for a particular graph.

Time ranges are calculated backwards from the present time. For example, you might set the time range so you can view the last 2 hours of data in a graph. You can also shift the time range to calculate backwards from an earlier point in time, for example, from 1 hour ago instead of from the present time.

[%header,cols="1,3"]
|===
2+| Time Range Shift Settings
| Override Relative Time | The amount of time to show in the x-axis of the graph (for example, `2h`). Information about this setting is displayed under the title of the graph unless you select Hide Time Override Info.
| Add Time Shift | Amount of time before now (the current time) to _end_ (or shift back in time) the duration set by Override Relative Time. For example, if the time right now is 10:00, and you shift the time to `1h` when the Override Relative Time is `2h`, end users will see the two hours of data available from 7:00 to 9:00, and the table will also display a message like this: `2 hours, ending 1 hour ago`.
| Hide Time Override Info | Checkbox for hiding the description  of any Override Relative Time and Time Shift settings from the graph.
|===

After you complete your configuration, you can click Save Changes. To exit the configuration and return to the dashboard, simply click the `X`.
